## C#

### Basics

Use `Console.Write()` and `Console.WriteLine()` to print messages to consoles.

Fields: `someField` - kinda like local variables; they don't have special getters and setters. camel case with lowercase first letter.

Proprerties: `MyProperty` - Variables that have special `get {}` and `set {}` functions.
